    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Academia (Off-white, Dark Slate, Muted Teal) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application featuring a vertical weekly timeline navigation and a main content area. This design replaces the static table with an interactive, non-linear experience, allowing users (students) to quickly jump to any week's details. The structure is organized into thematic modules (Foundations, Core Skills, Advanced Topics) to provide a clearer learning journey overview. A top-level data visualization (donut chart of activities) provides an immediate summary of the course's pedagogical approach, making it more engaging and informative than a simple list. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Main Content -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Method: Interactive timeline/content cards with JS -> Justification: Improves navigation and readability over a static table. 2. Teaching Activities -> Goal: Inform/Summarize -> Viz: Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Provides a high-level, visually engaging summary of the course's teaching methods, adding a dynamic element to the syllabus. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
